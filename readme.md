## A simple application to track student involvement

The [Green Engineering Scholars at Ohio
State](http://honors-scholars.osu.edu/scholars/programs/green-engineering) have
requirements for involvement such as attending certain numbers of events per
year.

This code lives at http://osugreenscholars.org and is deployed using Amazon Web
Services Elastic Beanstalk.
