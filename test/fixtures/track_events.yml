  info:  I'm not sure if this counts as a long term event but this is a class I'm taking this class to learn more about how to get involved in research in the EEOB department which culminates in me creating a research proposal and writing a grant proposal as well. Also, the date above is when I began the class and it continues on until the end of the semester.
